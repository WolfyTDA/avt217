<exhibitions>The Robert and Jane Meyerhoff Collection</exhibitions>
	<br>
	The Maryland couple began collecting art seriously in 1958, buying Hans Hofmann's Autumn Gold before its slabs of paint were dry. One of their last acquisitions was James Rosenquist's 2001 painting Spectator - Speed of Light. In the decades between, they assembled an exceptional collection of works ranging from expressionist to pop and abstract to figurative. In particular, the Meyerhoffs focused on five artists-Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, and Frank Stella-who led a new, rising generation of American painters.</article>

<exhibitions>International Poster Exhibition</exhibitions>
	<br>
	By definition, posters are images which convey information through text and/or imagery, typically designed for display in public spaces across billboards, bus stops, walls and more recently, digital spaces online through websites, blogs and social media. Within this exhibition posters advertise festivals, lectures, exhibitions, theater performances, sports games, and social gatherings. Some were designed with a political agenda; attempting to reveal truths and lies or contribute to ongoing dialogues of war, security, power and nationality. Others raise awareness of issues around equality, consumerism and privacy.</article>

<exhibitions>Kenneth Grange: Making Britain Modern</exhibitions>
	<br>
	A career-spanning survey of Kenneth Grange’s work, which includes his design for the InterCity 125 train. Emphasising the importance of Grange’s smaller, but equally iconic domestic products – including the Parker 25 pen, Kodak Instamatic camera and Kenwood Chef food mixer – a series of backdrop images was created with photographer Angela Moore. Running through both the exhibition and its promotional material, the giant images provided a consistent reminder of the products use a theatrical contrast with the scale and intimacy of the actual object. Exhibition texts were set in New Rail Alphabet, a version of the British Rail font used on the original InterCity 125 programme, revived in 2009 by Henrik Kubel and Margaret Calvert.</article>

<exhibitions>Fairy Tale Architecture</exhibitions>
	<br>
	Fairy Tale Architecture presents designs for unbuilt structures that explore the relationship between fairy tales and speculative architecture, melding art, architecture, and literary critique. Initially begun as a series for the online public architecture, landscape, and urbanism journal Places, the exhibition presents work melding architecture, design, and literary critique. Architects and designers from all over the world were invited to select a favorite tale, contemplate the promise of a magical home, and design new realms and spaces that explore this inquiry within the world of the fairy tale.</article>

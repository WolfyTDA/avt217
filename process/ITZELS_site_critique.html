	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>The navigation is incredibly easy to understand and interact with, its clear what catigories the pages go to as well as what they're about and is very responsive. There is little to no room for misunderstanding or mistake.<br>
The list format helps me a lot visually to know what im interacting with and the tabs coming down also shows a good visual representation of it and the darker color makes it more visible and eye catching.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>The page is incredibly responsive without being too sensitive to clicks preventing the user from accidentally going to a page they didnt want to go to, the colors on the tabs change color to show which ones you are hovering over or are on, to show the user what theyre on. </p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The fonts use are easy to read and aestetically pleasing though the main text is a bit small in my opinion. Without my glasses I cant make out what the words are compared to things like the header (though i do need time to properly make out the words.<br>
The writings hierarchy is easy to understand and flows very naturally, I really enjoy the simplicity of it all </p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>Overall the site is very well made and has a very clean and easy to understnad style and apperance, the page isnt overwhelming at all. The only complaint I would have are the colors used while you move around the page, it just feels a little random and kind of ugly to me. Its mainly just the green though, other than that the site feels very clean and is easy to navigate and understand while looking through it. I had no confusion in the slightest</p>
